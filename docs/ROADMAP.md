## Strategic Vision: "Extensible Performance"

**Competitive Position**: Fresh combines the performance of Rust-based editors (Zed, Helix) with the extensibility of VSCode and Neovim, while avoiding their pitfalls:
- ✅ Unlike Zed: Powerful plugin system (Lua, not WASM)
- ✅ Unlike Helix: Stable with large files, extensible architecture
- ✅ Unlike Neovim: Low configuration tax, integrated experience
- ✅ Unlike VSCode: Native performance, no Electron overhead

**Unique Advantage**: Marker-based overlays solve a fundamental problem that other editors struggle with - plugins can add UI decorations that automatically track text edits without manual repositioning. This unlocks powerful plugin capabilities not easily achievable elsewhere.

## Roadmap Phases

## Phase 1: Daily Driver Readiness (Q1 2025)

**Goal**: Close the feature gaps that prevent developers from using Fresh full-time.

### Priority 1: High-Value LSP Features

Implement the "big three" LSP features that have outsized impact on developer experience:

1. **textDocument/hover** - Show documentation on mouse hover or Ctrl+K
   - Display type information, doc comments
   - Render markdown formatting
   - Show in non-intrusive popup

2. **textDocument/codeAction** - Quick fixes and refactorings
   - Trigger on Ctrl+. or lightbulb icon
   - Show available actions in menu
   - Apply edits to buffer

3. **textDocument/references** - Find all usages
   - Show results in quickfix-style panel
   - Jump to reference locations
   - Group by file

**Impact**: These three features alone cover 80% of daily LSP usage and make Fresh competitive with mainstream IDEs.

### Priority 2: Essential Smart Editing

Focus on the highest-impact editing features:

1. **Bracket Matching & Auto-pairing**
   - Highlight matching brackets on cursor position
   - Auto-close brackets, quotes, parens
   - Smart deletion (remove both opening and closing)

2. **Comment Toggling** (Ctrl+/)
   - Language-aware comment syntax
   - Toggle line comments, block comments
   - Works with selections and multi-cursor

**Impact**: These features have an outsized effect on the perceived "polish" of the editing experience.

### Priority 3: Search Enhancements

Complete the search & replace feature set:

1. **Case-sensitive/Whole-word toggles**
   - Add UI controls to search prompt
   - Persist settings across searches

2. **Multi-file search** (leverage git-grep plugin)
   - Integrate git-grep results with replace workflow
   - Project-wide find/replace

______________________________________________________________________

## Phase 2: Showcase the Plugin System (Q2 2025)

**Goal**: Demonstrate Fresh's unique architectural advantages through killer-app plugins.

### Priority 1: Magit-Style Git Interface

Build a comprehensive Git UI that's only possible due to Fresh's plugin architecture:

**Requirements**:
- Custom buffer with keybindings (virtual buffer API)
- Async git operations (✅ already implemented)
- Interactive staging/unstaging hunks
- Commit UI with message editor
- Branch switching, log viewer
- Diff visualization

**Why it matters**:
- Demonstrates the full power of the plugin system
- Addresses a major pain point in terminal editors
- Proves Fresh can match/exceed Emacs Magit (the gold standard)

### Priority 2: Advanced Plugin APIs

Implement the remaining APIs needed for showcase plugins:

1. **Virtual Buffers & Custom Modes**
   - Read-only buffers with custom rendering
   - Buffer-local keybindings
   - Custom contexts for modal interaction

2. **Enhanced UI APIs**
   - Tree/list widgets for structured data
   - Split/panel management from plugins
   - Status bar segments

3. **Integration APIs**
   - LSP query API (access diagnostics from plugins)
   - Search API (invoke search, get state)
   - Undo history API (query undo tree)

**Target Showcases** (in order):
1. ✅ Git grep & find file (COMPLETE)
2. Magit-style Git interface
3. Telescope-style fuzzy finder
4. Undo tree visualizer
5. Project-wide search & replace

______________________________________________________________________

______________________________________________________________________

## Technical Priorities

### High Priority: Line Cache Refactoring

**Problem**: Line number ↔ byte offset conversions are a major bottleneck:
- `populate_line_cache()` takes **61.95%** of diagnostic processing time
- Separate systems for markers (IntervalTree, lazy) and lines (BTreeMap, eager)

**Solution**: Unify line tracking into IntervalTree marker system
- Lines ARE intervals (between newlines)
- O(log N) edits instead of O(K log K)
- Single source of truth for all position tracking
- Sparse caching (only accessed lines)

**Expected Gain**: 62% reduction in LSP diagnostic processing time

### Medium Priority: Line Wrapping Refactoring

Unify wrapping/no-wrapping code paths, fix style preservation during wrapping, eliminate duplicate cursor calculations.

### Ongoing: Test Infrastructure

- Lua plugin testing framework
- Performance regression tests
- Visual regression testing expansion
- E2E tests for complex workflows

## Anti-Goals

What Fresh explicitly **won't** focus on:

❌ **Emulate Vim/Emacs keybindings** - Standard modern keybindings by default (plugins can add modal editing)

❌ **Be all things to all people** - Focus on text editing excellence, not replacing IDEs entirely

❌ **Compete on language-specific features** - Let LSP and plugins handle language support

❌ **Support every platform** - Linux/macOS/Windows desktop first, no mobile/web

______________________________________________________________________

## How to Contribute

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for guidelines.

**High-impact areas**:
1. LSP feature implementation (hover, code actions, references)
2. Plugin development (showcase the system!)
3. Smart editing features (bracket matching, comment toggle)
