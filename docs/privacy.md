# Privacy & Telemetry

Fresh checks for new versions to notify you when upgrades are available. Alongside this, it sends basic anonymous telemetry to help understand usage patterns. Both are part of the same daily check.

The data collected includes:

- Fresh version
- Operating system and architecture (e.g., `linux-x86_64`, `macos-aarch64`)
- Terminal type (the `TERM` environment variable)

No personal data, file contents, or usage behavior is collected. The check runs once on startup and then once daily.

## Disabling Upgrade Checks and Telemetry

You can disable both upgrade checking and telemetry with the same flag:

**Command line flag:**
```bash
fresh --no-upgrade-check
```

**Configuration file** (`~/.config/fresh/config.json`):
```json
{
  "check_for_updates": false
}
```
