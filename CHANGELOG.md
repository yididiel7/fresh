---

## 0.1.25

### Features

* **GPM Mouse Support**: Added mouse support in Linux virtual consoles (TTY) via the GPM daemon (#231). Uses dlopen to load libgpm.so at runtime, so the binary works on systems without GPM installed. Gracefully falls back to standard terminal mouse protocol when GPM is unavailable.

  - Ctrl+A: Home (beginning of line)
  - Ctrl+E: End (end of line)
  - Ctrl+K: Kill to end of line
  - Ctrl+U: Kill to beginning of line
  - Ctrl+W: Kill word backward

## 0.1.14

See git history for changes.

---

## 0.1.13

### Features

* **Git Gutter Plugin**: Shows git diff indicators in the gutter for lines changed vs HEAD:
  - │ (green): Added line
  - │ (yellow): Modified line
  - ▾ (red): Deleted line(s) below

* **Buffer Modified Plugin**: Shows unsaved changes with │ (blue) indicators for lines modified since last save.

* **Line Indicator System**: New plugin API for gutter indicators with automatic position tracking. Indicators use byte-position markers that shift automatically when text is inserted/deleted. Priority system allows multiple indicator types to coexist (diagnostics > git > buffer modified).

* **LCS-Based Line Diff**: Buffer modified indicators now use the classic LCS (Longest Common Subsequence) algorithm - the foundation of Unix diff - for accurate change detection. Correctly handles insertions without marking shifted lines as changed, and detects deletion points.

* **Content-Based Diff**: Diff comparison now uses actual byte content rather than piece tree structure. This means if you delete text and paste it back, the indicator correctly clears because the content matches the saved state.

### Bug Fixes

* **Save As Undo History**: Fixed undo history being cleared after Save As due to auto-revert triggered by file watcher detecting the newly created file. Uses optimistic concurrency with mtime comparison to avoid spurious reverts.

* **Save As Dirty State**: Fixed undo dirty state not being tracked correctly after Save As on unnamed buffers (issue #191).

### Performance

* **Large File Mode**: Diffing is now disabled in large file mode for performance. Uses the simpler is_modified() flag instead of expensive diff calculations for files with >10MB or unknown line counts.

---

## 0.1.12

### Features

* **File Explorer Improvements**:
  - Shows file sizes (KB/MB/GB) and directory entry counts
  - Close button (×) in title bar to hide explorer
  - Left arrow on file/collapsed directory selects parent
  - Keybinding changed from Ctrl+B to Ctrl+E (avoids tmux conflict)

* **Split View Close Buttons**: Split views now show a × button on the right side of the tab row (only when multiple splits exist) for easy closing.

* **Close Last Buffer**: Closing the last buffer now creates a fresh anonymous buffer instead of blocking with "Cannot close last buffer".

* **Alt+W Keybinding**: New shortcut to close the current tab.

* **Command Palette Source Column**: Shows where each command comes from - "builtin" or the plugin filename - in a right-aligned column.

* **Relative Buffer Names**: Buffer display names are now shown relative to the working directory.

### Bug Fixes

* **File Explorer Toggle**: Fixed Ctrl+B/Ctrl+E toggle not working correctly - now properly opens/closes instead of just focusing.

* **Session Restore**: Fixed file explorer not initializing when restoring a session with explorer visible.

* **Open File Popup**: Hide status bar when file browser popup is shown; improved high-contrast theme colors (cyan instead of yellow).

## 0.1.11

See git history for changes.

---

## 0.1.10

### Features

* **Session Persistence**: Automatically saves per-project state (open files, tabs, split layout, cursor/scroll positions, file explorer state, search/replace history and options, bookmarks) to the XDG data dir and restores it on launch. Session restore is skipped when opening a specific file; use `--no-session` to start fresh.

* **Unified Search & Replace**: Replace (Ctrl+H) and Query Replace (Ctrl+Shift+H) now share the same interface with a "Confirm each" toggle (Alt+E). Query Replace enables confirmation by default; Replace uses the toggle state. Confirmation prompt shows `(y)es (n)o (a)ll (c)ancel` options.

### Bug Fixes

* **Session Restore Reliability**: Fixed session rehydration to reopen files/splits with the correct active buffer, cursor, and scroll position (including nested splits) instead of jumping back to the top on first render.

* **macOS Build**: Fixed Linux-specific `.init_array` by using cross-platform V8 initialization.

* **Syntax Highlighting**: Fixed invisible/hard-to-read highlighting in light and nostalgia themes by using theme-based color resolution instead of hardcoded colors.

* **Theme Colors**: Improved status bar and prompt colors across all themes (dark, high-contrast, light, nostalgia).

* **Search Prompt**: Search/replace prompts now cancel when focus leaves the editor (switching buffers or focusing file explorer).

---

## 0.1.9

* **Scroll Keybindings**: Fixed Ctrl+Up/Down scroll not working by syncing viewport between SplitViewState and EditorState.

---

## 0.1.7

### Features

* **Select Theme Command**: New theme picker accessible from the command palette and View menu. Includes a new "nostalgia" theme inspired by Turbo Pascal 5 / WordPerfect 5.

* **Compose Mode Improvements**: Paper-on-desk visual effect with desk margin colors, and hanging indent support for markdown lists and blockquotes.

* **Binary File Detection**: Binary files are now detected and opened in read-only mode to prevent accidental corruption.

### Bug Fixes

* **Light Theme**: Fixed colors for status bar, prompt, scrollbar, tabs, and file explorer to use proper light theme colors.

* **Mouse Performance**: Fixed slow mouse movement on large terminals by skipping redundant renders when hover target hasn't changed. Added mouse event coalescing to skip stale positions.

* **UTF-8 Truncation**: Fixed panic when truncating suggestion descriptions mid-character.

### Internal Changes

* **Code Refactoring**: Major cleanup extracting helpers and reducing duplication across many modules including `process_async_messages`, `handle_plugin_command`, `render_view_lines`, `multi_cursor`, `highlight_color`, and more. Consolidated duplicate `hook_args_to_json` implementations.

* **Test Improvements**: Fixed flaky tests by removing timing assertions, made shortcut tests platform-aware for macOS.

* **Documentation**: Reorganized internal planning docs, updated plugin README from Lua to TypeScript, and added embedded help manual using `include_str!()`.
