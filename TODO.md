# Editor Implementation Plan

> **Maintenance Note**: When features are completed, remove detailed implementation sections and keep only a single-line summary in "Implemented Features" at the top. This keeps the TODO file focused on what's next, not what's done.

- **File operations**: Open, edit, save with dirty tracking
- **Multiple buffers**: Tab-based interface
- **Clipboard**: Copy/paste between buffers and cursors
